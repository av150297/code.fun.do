Our Current project idea is for the hurricanes and cyclones prediction. We will build a android app which will use the person’s location to extract out the weather information of that area. Specially, our main goal is to find the temperature and pressure difference in that area so that we can predict if there is any possibility of cyclone or not. There are many parameters which will determine the possibility of cyclone but temperature and pressure difference are our foremost objective. We will use machine learning algorithm to train our app to determine the prediction of the disaster. Our android app is available on individual’s mobile so that they get a notification of any possible disaster near them through their mobile phone. It will take care of every past record of cyclone or hurricane so that their predictions are quite accurate. The advantage of this project is that the mobile is available to everyone and they will get instant notification so that they can take necessary actions.
